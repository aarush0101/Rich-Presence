# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment (Pledge)

We are dedicated to creating a welcoming, safe, and respectful environment for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity, race, ability, experience level, or background. We expect all members of this community to be as well of the same mindset. We aspire in a peaceful and calm community with nothing but a vision and a thirst to do something wonderful for the world.

We pride ourselves on various scopes, including but not limited to entrepreneurship activities, sports, coding projects, events, meetups, and most importantly, making the world a better place for the next generation to thrive in. We wish that the world till 2030 would be a different picture from what we see today.

## Why is this code here?

This code is here because we want to ensure that new people who are trying to dive deep into the Discord Gateway API, or any of the discord rest API(s), have a clear base to start with. We want to ensure that they can learn how to use these APIs effectively and responsibly. This code is only present for educational purposes, and we do not encourage anyone to use this code for malicious purposes. We want to ensure that the community is aware of the potential risks and benefits of using these APIs, and that they are able to use them in a way that is safe and responsible.

## What do we expect from you?

We do not ask for much, but it'd be wonderful if you could follow our mission and pledge in your day-to-day life.
We love a respectful and considerate community, which listens to before reacting to something, and most importantly, helps us build a positive impact and respect other people's space.

## Behaviors that should not be display.

Any kind of harassment, discrimination, hate speech, or deliberate disruption is strictly not accepted at any cost. While a bit of mucking around is fine, we expect the community to respect other's boundaries and not provide any kind of threats to them, online or offline.

## Scope

This CODE OF CONDUCT applies to all project spaces â€” including online interactions, public channels, private messages, and events, including those hosted by third parties. It also applies to all community members, including contributors, maintainers, and anyone who interacts with the project.

## Zendo's Right

Zendo Asia reserves the right to modify or change this CODE OF CONDUCT at any time. We will communicate any changes clearly and promptly. Continued participation in the community after changes have been made constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## What is Zendo?

Zendo is a project that aims to provide a platform for people to learn, share, and collaborate on various topics. It is a community-driven initiative that encourages open communication, respect, and inclusively. Zendo is not just about coding; it is about building a better future together.

## Then Why is Zendo mentioned here?

Because Zendo is right now being handled by the same team that handles Rich Presence, and we want to ensure that the community is aware of it
